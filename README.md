# Stock Market Simulator
Developing and upgrading my first year university object-orientated programming project.
>This program will only work on windows command line due to my unique way of clearing the screen through CLS (for clear screen)
# To run this program
>Assuming you have all the Java essentials to run Java code on terminal and added the correct PATH
1. Download all the files from the git repository
2. Navigate to the folder that contains all the files from the repository on Windows Command Line
3. run `java StockMarketSimulator.java`

DISCLAIMER: This is still a developing project so expect some bugs but feel free to test the bugs and let me know :)
